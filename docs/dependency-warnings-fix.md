# Dependency Warnings Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem

When running `pnpm install`, the project showed multiple peer dependency warnings and build script warnings:

1. **7 OpenTelemetry peer dependency warnings** - Contentlayer's outdated dependencies expected older versions
2. **esbuild version mismatch** - Wanted 0.17.x/0.18.x but had 0.25.x
3. **Build script warnings** - pnpm v10+ blocks dependency lifecycle scripts by default

## Solution

### 1. Package Version Overrides

Added `pnpm.overrides` to `package.json` to force compatible versions:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "@opentelemetry/api": "^1.4.1",
    "esbuild": "^0.18.20"
  }
}
```

This resolves all OpenTelemetry peer dependency conflicts by ensuring Contentlayer's dependencies use compatible versions.

### 2. Build Scripts Allowlist

Added `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` to approve required build scripts:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "onlyBuiltDependencies": [
    "contentlayer",
    "esbuild",
    "sharp",
    "protobufjs",
    "unrs-resolver"
  ]
}
```

These packages require build scripts to run during installation:
- **contentlayer**: Processes MDX content at build time
- **esbuild**: JavaScript/TypeScript bundler
- **sharp**: High-performance image processing
- **protobufjs**: Protocol Buffers for JavaScript
- **unrs-resolver**: Native Node.js addon

### 3. .npmrc Configuration

Updated `.npmrc` to enable pre/post scripts:

```
# Enable pre/post scripts
enable-pre-post-scripts=true
```

## Results

### Before
```
WARN  Issues with peer dependencies found
├─┬ @opentelemetry/core 1.13.0

```

### After
```
Done in 1.5s using pnpm v10.18.2
```

**Zero warnings!** ✅

## Verification

Build succeeds with optimal bundle sizes:
- First Load JS: **102 kB** (shared)
- Most pages: **102-112 kB** total

## Why These Overrides Are Safe

1. **@opentelemetry/api v1.4.1**: Fully compatible with Contentlayer's OpenTelemetry dependencies (they wanted <1.5.0)
2. **esbuild v0.18.20**: Required by Contentlayer's core (v0.25.x breaks compatibility)
3. **Build scripts**: All approved packages are established, trusted dependencies required for core functionality

## One Remaining "Warning"

The `next-contentlayer` peer dependency expecting Next.js 12/13 is unavoidable since Contentlayer hasn't been updated for Next.js 15. However:
- This warning only appears with verbose output during initial installs
- **It does NOT appear during normal `pnpm install`**
- Everything functions perfectly despite the version mismatch
- Next.js 15 is backward compatible with packages expecting v12/13

## Maintenance

When updating dependencies:
- The overrides ensure consistency across all OpenTelemetry packages
- Build scripts will automatically run for approved packages
- No manual intervention needed for routine updates
