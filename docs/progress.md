2. **Build scripts need approval** - Run `pnpm approve-builds` to enable build scripts for contentlayer, esbuild, sharp, protobufjs, unrs-resolver.
3. **No profile photo yet** - Need to add image to `/public/images/`
4. **ESLint config warning** - Minor import path warning in eslint.config.mjs (does not affect build)
