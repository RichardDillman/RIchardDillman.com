## Summary

I love building products that feel fast, reliable, and human. Over the years I've grown and mentored engineering teams across healthcare, media, and tech, modernizing platforms and improving how people work together. I focus on clear goals, solid systems, and results that customers can feel and companies can measure. Nearly a decade later, my code still powers ads on sites like Vogue, GQ, Wired, and The New Yorker.
