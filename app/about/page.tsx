              I love building fast, reliable products, and helping others grow while I
              do it. I&apos;m passionate about SEO, Page Speed, and clean, scalable
              code. At The Muse, I lead with curiosity, clarity, and care, bridging
              tech and business. Nearly a decade later, my code still powers ads
              on sites like Vogue, GQ, Wired, and The New Yorker.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;m focused on mentorship, performance optimization, and build speed. My stack centers on
              TypeScript and Next.js, but I&apos;ve spent decades working across the web platform, from Python/Tornado
              monoliths to modern React architectures, from state government systems to global media properties.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the past 20+ years, I&apos;ve built systems that serve millions of users
              daily. At <strong>Cond√© Nast</strong>, I modernized ad delivery infrastructure
              across 30+ publications reaching 229M+ monthly users. At{" "}
              <strong>The Muse</strong>, I&apos;ve led engineering through multiple platform
              migrations, cutting build times from 45 minutes to 75 seconds and
              driving significant improvements in SEO, revenue, and user engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before that, I founded <strong>CatalpaSoft</strong>, where I built
              child welfare platforms that accelerated foster care placements by 50%
              across thousands of families. Earlier still, I helped build systems for
              the State of Indiana, Everyday Health, and organizations serving millions
              of people seeking critical information.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">How I Lead</h2>

            <p>
              I believe great engineering leadership means staying technical while
              scaling people and systems. I write code, review PRs, debug production
              issues, and mentor engineers, from junior ICs to senior architects. I&apos;ve
              even formalized <strong>Claude Code</strong> as a structured contributor
              on my team, treating AI as a force multiplier that still requires tight
              direction and thorough review.
            </p>

            <p>
              I care deeply about the fundamentals: <strong>Web Vitals</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>Lighthouse scores</strong>, accessibility, observability, and
              developer experience. I&apos;ve built experimentation into workflows so we
              can measure what we ship. I&apos;ve standardized linting, typing, testing,
              and formatting pipelines across teams to improve velocity and reduce
              bugs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most importantly, I lead with <strong>curiosity, clarity, and care</strong>.
              I ask questions, explain decisions, and make sure everyone (engineers,
              product managers, designers, and stakeholders) understands not just{" "}
              <em>what</em> we&apos;re building, but <em>why</em>.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Outside of Work</h2>

            <p>
              When I&apos;m not optimizing build pipelines or debugging Core Web Vitals,
              you&apos;ll find me gardening, playing Elder Scrolls Online, reading about
              Egyptology, or experimenting with bookbinding and typography. I&apos;m
              fascinated by craft, systems, and the intersection of art and
              engineering.
