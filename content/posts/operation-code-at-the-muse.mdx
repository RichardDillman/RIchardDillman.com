This spring we were honored to connect with [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/) to host their April Meetup. Operation Code is a non-profit organization serving America’s veterans and their families to help them to sort out their next steps after their service - or sometimes, while they’re still serving. Helping people to find their passions and turn them into fulfilling careers is exactly what we do at The Muse, and we were delighted to pitch in. This being Operation Code, Engineering and Product were particularly excited to get involved.

How do you transition into the civilian workforce as a developer? Senior Application Engineer [Richard Dillman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richarddillman/) moderated a panel of Musers to explain how to master the technical job search, and how to maintain that success once hired. Director of Talent and Acquisition [Lillian Landrum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lillianlandrum/) shared how candidates can stand out in the selection process. Manager of Client Project Management [Danielle Incontrera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-incontrera-diflorio-62ab1445/) discussed how people on the technical side can more effectively communicate with product about goals and timelines. Account Manager [Christina Giordano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giordanochristina/) explained how engineers help in both sales and client acquisition at The Muse.
Director of Engineering [Peenak Inamdar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peenakinamdar/) fielded questions on what skills developers need to have on his team and how we at The Muse determine if a candidate’s skills meet those needs.

Following Peenak’s remarks, Associate Product Manager [James Mayr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbmayr/) gave a presentation on [Google Tools for Product and Engineering](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IJx9REna-iJaYgezXwxI0pQBtkG79EWVrJZwrRy3_Fk), an overview of how developers can use Google tools such as Optimize, Analytics, Tag Manager, Lighthouse and Google Search Console to monitor site performance, dynamically add or modify content, and develop approaches to increase speed and reliability. We spent quite a bit of time on accessibility and usability too.

Afterwards there was more pizza and more networking amongst all, with the most popular topic being breaking into the developer role as a fresh code camp graduate. Our conversation carried well past our 9PM target with some of us not leaving until well past 10.

Meetups and Operation Code are both great ways to meet people you otherwise might not, learn new skills, and possibly make a connection for a new career.
